    """A 2-dimensional lattice environment from Dill and Lau, 1989
    [dill1989lattice]_.

    It follows an absolute Cartesian coordinate system, the location of
    the polymer is stated independently from one another. Thus, we have
    four actions (left, right, up, and down) and a chance of collision.

    The environment will first place the initial polymer at the origin.
    Then, for each step, agents place another polymer to the lattice. An episode
    ends when all polymers are placed, i.e. when the length of the action
    chain is equal to the length of the input sequence minus 1. We then
    compute the reward using the energy minimization rule.

    Attributes

    seq : str
        Polymer sequence describing a particular protein.
    state : OrderedDict

        This method returns a set of values similar to the OpenAI gym, that

        The observations are arranged as a :code:`numpy.ndarray` matrix, more
        suitable for agents built using convolutional neural networks. The
        'H' is represented as :code:`1`s whereas the 'P's as :code:`-1`s.

        not its grid-like representation, can be accessed from
        :code:`info['state_chain]`.
